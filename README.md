Includes the following projects:
1. VIX Stats Analysis.  This model gives the historical average, rolling 20 day standard deviation and other statistical results. The model also presents statistically relevant signals. The signals appear to be leading indicators. This model uses ARIMA to forecast in sample 3 day out VIX movements with a RMSE of 2.5.
