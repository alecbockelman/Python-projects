This project deals with general statistics of the VIX. The Vix signals are created by looking at the past 20 day rolling std dev.
When the std dev falls below the 15th percentile it appears to be a good indicator a VIX spike may occur soon.
These signals are given by the green and black dots. They are leading indicators. A black dot on average returns 28 % gain in the VIX. 63 days was chosen because it is a quarterly
forecast = 252/4.
